# Mail Spam Detection using Machine Learning
This project implements a Spam Email Classifier using Na誰ve Bayes and a user-friendly Streamlit interface. It helps users quickly identify whether a message is spam or not based on its textual content.

## Project Overview
Goal: Classify emails as spam or not spam

Model Used: Na誰ve Bayes Classifier

Dataset Source: Kaggle

GUI: Built using Streamlit

## Key Features
Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)

Model trained using Multinomial Na誰ve Bayes

Achieved 99% precision score

Real-time predictions via a simple web interface

## Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK / Regex (for text cleaning)

Streamlit (for GUI)


## Model Performance
Precision: 99%

Highly effective in filtering out spam messages

Lightweight and fast prediction time

## How It Works
User enters email text in the Streamlit app.

Text is cleaned and transformed into numerical format using TF-IDF.

Na誰ve Bayes model predicts whether it is Spam or Not Spam.

The result is instantly displayed.
